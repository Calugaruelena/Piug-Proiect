            <p>The rover has arrived at a special region believed to have formed as Mars’ climate was drying.</p>

            <p>After journeying this summer through a narrow, sand-lined pass, NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover 
                recently arrived in the “sulfate-bearing unit,” a long-sought region of Mount Sharp enriched with salty minerals.<br><br>
                Scientists hypothesize that billions of years ago, streams, and ponds left behind the minerals as the water dried up. Assuming the
                 hypothesis is correct, these minerals offer tantalizing clues as to how – and why
                 – the Red Planet’s climate changed from being more Earth-like to the frozen desert it is today. <br><br>
                 The minerals were spotted by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter years before Curiosity landed in 2012, so scientists have
                  been waiting a long time to see this terrain up close. Soon after arriving, the rover discovered a diverse array of rock types 
                  and signs of past water, among them popcorn-textured nodules and salty minerals such as magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt is one kind),
                   calcium sulfate (including gypsum), and sodium chloride (ordinary table salt).<br><br><br><br><br>

            <p> They selected a rock nicknamed “Canaima” for the mission's 36th drill sample, and choosing was no easy task. Along with scientific 
        considerations, the team had to factor in the rover hardware. Curiosity uses a percussive, or jackhammering, rotary drill at the
         end of its 7-foot (2-meter) arm to pulverize rock samples for analysis. 
        Worn brakes on the arm recently led the team to conclude that some harder rocks may require too much hammering to drill safely.
        <br><br>
        “As we do before every drill, we brushed away the dust and then poked the top surface of Canaima with the drill. The lack
         of scratch marks or indentations was an indication that it may prove difficult to drill,” said Curiosity’s new project manager,
          Kathya Zamora-Garcia of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “We paused to consider whether that posed any risk 
          to our arm. With the new drilling algorithm, 
        created to minimize the use of percussion, we felt comfortable collecting a sample of Canaima. As it turned out, no percussion was needed.”
           <br><br>The mission’s scientists look forward to analyzing portions of the sample with the Chemical 
           and Minerology instrument (CheMin) and the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument (SAM).<br><br><br> </p>
